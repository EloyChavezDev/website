### 23. Hash Function: A mathematical function that converts data into a fixed-size value called a hash. Hashes are used to verify the integrity of data and to create digital signatures.

**Example:** Hash functions are used to ensure that files have not been tampered with and to verify the authenticity of software downloads.

### 24. Homomorphic Encryption: A type of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it first.

**Example:** Homomorphic encryption can be used to protect sensitive data while it is being processed in the cloud.

### 25. Incident Response: The process of responding to a cybersecurity incident, such as a data breach or malware infection.

**Example:** Incident response plans are important for businesses to have in place to minimize the impact of a cybersecurity incident.

### 26. Information Security: The practice of protecting information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

**Example:** Information security is a critical component of cybersecurity.

### 27. Input Validation: The process of checking user input for security vulnerabilities.

**Example:** Input validation can help to prevent attackers from injecting malicious code into a system.

### 28. Integrity: The assurance that data is accurate, complete, and consistent.
