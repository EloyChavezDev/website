##### Introduction
Microsoft has been recognized as a Leader in Gartner's 2024 *Magic Quadrant* for Desktop as a Service (DaaS) for the second year in a row. This recognition highlights Microsoft's commitment to providing innovative and scalable solutions, with built-in security, in an ever-changing market landscape.

DaaS, as defined by Gartner, is the provision of virtual desktops by a public cloud or service provider. Microsoft offers comprehensive solutions that allow businesses to choose between self-assembled and vendor-assembled services, meeting a wide range of organizational needs.

##### Innovation and scalability
To ensure businesses have the best tools for flexible working, Microsoft is continually improving its cloud-based solutions. Windows 365, for example, brings the Windows operating system to the Microsoft cloud, providing a new way for employees of all types to experience Windows 11 or Windows 10. This allows IT administrators to easily configure, deploy, manage and secure Cloud PCs, maximizing existing technology resources.

##### Focus on security
Security is a priority for Microsoft, with recent features such as one-way clipboard protection, mobile app management controls for mobile devices, and secure default settings. These enhancements aim to protect users and data, while providing a unified user experience across various platforms.

---

##### Market Growth and Trends
According to Gartner, DaaS spending is expected to grow from $3.0 billion in 2024 to $4.4 billion in 2028, with a compound annual growth rate of 10%. This growth is partly due to disruptions in the on-premises virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) market. Additionally, DaaS deployments increasingly meet sustainability needs, in addition to enabling secure remote working.

---

##### Essential and Standard Abilities
DaaS solutions should include essential capabilities such as a provider-managed cloud control plane, a secure remote desktop protocol, and the ability to connect from various endpoints. Standard capabilities include image management, orchestration of compute and storage resources, and monitoring of virtual desktop usage and performance.
