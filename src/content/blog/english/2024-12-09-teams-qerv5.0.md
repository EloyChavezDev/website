##### Introduction
Microsoft Teams continues to evolve, providing high-quality communication and collaboration experiences. The Quality of Experience Report (QER) v5.0 is a significant update that introduces intelligent media quality classifiers, enabling IT administrators to better identify the root causes of call quality issues.

The intelligent media quality classifiers use machine learning algorithms to analyze the quality of audio, video, and screen sharing streams. Unlike traditional classifiers that relied on simple thresholds, these advanced tools offer a more nuanced view of call telemetry. They help identify not only good or poor streams but also the underlying issues affecting call quality.

##### How the classifiers work
These classifiers evaluate call quality by considering various factors such as network performance, device capabilities, and input devices1. For instance, if a user reports poor audio quality, the classifiers can determine whether the issue stems from the user's network connection or another participant's connection.

##### Using Power BI to analyze CQD Data
The QER v5.0 is integrated into the Power BI query templates for the Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) in Microsoft Teams. These templates allow administrators to customize and distribute detailed reports on call and meeting quality. The reports include metrics on meeting health, media reliability, and the impact of devices and VPNs on call quality.
