However, users often prefer external cameras for their superior qualities (better resolution, angle adjustment, lighting, etc.) for video conferencing. Whether you are hosting a meeting in a well-lit conference room or giving a presentation from your home office, an external camera can greatly enhance the quality and professionalism of your video feed.
