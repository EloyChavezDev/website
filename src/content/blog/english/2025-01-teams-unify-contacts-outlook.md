##### Introduction
Microsoft recently announced the general availability of the new unified contacts experience in Microsoft Teams and Outlook. This update allows Microsoft 365 users to access and manage the same set of contacts in both apps, providing a more integrated and efficient collaboration experience.

##### Unified contacts features
- Automatic sync : All contact updates are now synced between Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft Graph APIs. This means that any changes made to a contact in one app will be automatically reflected in the other, saving time and effort.
- Category labels : User annotations on contacts, such as category labels, are also synced, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience.
- Duplicate management : If there are obvious duplicates between Outlook and Teams contacts, they will be merged into a single contact in the new unified experience. If conflicts arise during the merge, a copy of the contact with Teams data will be created and clearly labeled as *"Teams Conflict"* for review by users.

- Reduced duplication : By eliminating unnecessary duplication, this merger simplifies contact management and ensures smoother interface usage.
