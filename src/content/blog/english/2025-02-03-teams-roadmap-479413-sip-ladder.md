##### Introduction
Microsoft Teams continues to evolve to offer ever more advanced communication and collaboration solutions. Among the features arriving very soon, we find the possibility of obtaining the SIP ladder for debugging Teams calls.

---

##### Availability
This feature will be available to administrators from the Microsoft Teams Admin Center in the *Usage reports* menu and will allow analysis of SIP requests as well as their responses and SDPs between Teams and your SBC. The deployment will be gradual from March 2025. Good news for those in charge of Teams telephony support.
