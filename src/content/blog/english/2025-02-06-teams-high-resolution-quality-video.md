##### Introduction
Microsoft continues to innovate to provide users with the best possible virtual communication experience. One of the latest advancements is the introduction of *Super Resolution* (SR) for Microsoft Teams, announced at <u>Microsoft Ignite 2024</u>. This feature is now available in *Public Preview* and will be generally available in March 2025.

##### What is Super Resolution?
*Super Resolution* uses artificial intelligence to improve video quality, especially in poor network conditions. When bandwidth is limited, Teams may transmit lower resolution videos, resulting in lower visual quality. Traditionally, Teams used conventional scaling methods, often responsible for blurry visuals. *Super Resolution* restores video resolution using AI, producing significantly improved images.

##### Operation and advantages
During a Teams call with low resolution incoming video (e.g. 360p), *Super Resolution* can improve the quality up to a view size of 720p. Testing showed an average increase of +0.6 CMOS (Comparative Mean Opinion Score) in quality, where users rated the difference in quality on a scale of -3 (much morse) to +3 (much better). Additionally, 68% of users rated *Super Resolution* results as superior.

##### Automatic activation
*Super Resolution* is automatically enabled when bandwidth is limited, ensuring better video quality without manual intervention. However, this feature is disabled by default when devices are running on battery power to save power.
