##### Introduction
Microsoft announced that *Microsoft Purview* protection policies for *Azure Data Lake* and *Blob Storage* are now available in all regions. This advancement allows organizations to strengthen data governance and protect sensitive information in a consistent and automated manner.

---

##### Data governance challenges
Organizations face a critical challenge : ensuring consistent and automated data governance across rapidly expanding data sets. With the growth of AI and increased reliance on volumes of data for training models, data and security leaders must prevent unintended exposure of sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) and credit card information.

##### Secure storage solutions
Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) provide scalable, secure, and highly available cloud storage solutions. Although solutions like role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC), and access control lists (ACLs) help manage data access securely, they often operate on metadata such as file paths, tags, or container names. However, there are scenarios where it is necessary to implement automatic access controls based on the sensitivity of the content itself.

---

##### Microsoft Information Protection (MIP)
This is where integrated solutions like *Microsoft Information Protection* (MIP) come into play. MIP protection policies allow organizations to scan and label data based on the content stored in blobs. This allows access controls to be applied directly to the content of data assets across storage accounts. By eliminating the need for internal scanning and labeling, MIP simplifies compliance and helps enforce consistent data governance using a centralized solution.
