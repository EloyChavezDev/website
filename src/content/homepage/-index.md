    - title: "Using BigQuery to analyze genetic variants at scale"
      description: "This pipeline fetches or generates VCF files, converts them into Avro batches, and efficiently ingests them into BigQuery using custom schemas. Partitioning and clustering optimize storage and query performance for large-scale genomic datasets."

    - title: "Arkadia - IoT Home Environment Monitoring System"
      description: "A microservices architecture with containerized services, a custom BME280 client, and a React frontend. The system demonstrates continuous data processing through a polling-based pipeline including real-time sensor readings, Redis caching, FastAPI endpoints, and data visualizations."

    - title: "Batch-Based Contig Alignment: Speeding Up Comparative Genomics"
      description: "A resilient data pipeline must decompose large-scale tasks into smaller, more manageable units. Here I apply this principle to genomics, specifically for aligning genome assemblies to each other, including both technical details and scientific interpretation."
